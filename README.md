dpd_simulation
==============

1) Set parameters in input file (example file is already present)

2) Start the simulation. Parameters are the input file and the name of the output for the result.
    for example:  python DPD_main.py input /results/result (filename has to be "result" at the moment, only the directory can be changed)
    
3) Start the vizualization. For example: python ../results/ [--first NUMBER_OF_STEP] [--last NUMBER_OF_STEP]

4) Enjoy ;)
